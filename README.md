# houdini-shl-doxygen

The documentation refers to a standard library of header files that have been developed in SideFX. These are mainly VEX, OSL, OCL header files, but the library can be extended with other types if desired.

## Motivation

The Houdini documentation contains quite a lot of useful information, but still it lacks descriptions and definitions about header files that are used in snippets hidden in HDA. It is very difficult to use something you don't know enough about. 
The purpose of this work was to get documentation about these header files so that it is easy to use them as well as the rest of the documentation in Houdini.
